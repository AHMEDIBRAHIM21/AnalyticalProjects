- I installed these pachages so that I can vizualize and manipulate the data:
- tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science.
- skimr is a package for generating summary statistics and visualizations for data frames
- janitor is a package for cleaning and tidying messy datasets
- dplyr is a package for data manipulation and transformation.
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

-------------------------------------- 
---I inputed the data (hotel_bookings) so that I could view it with certain functions such as (head) and (summary) to get a good idea about the columns that exist within the data and see what should be analyzed for patterns¶
hotel_bookings <- list.files("hotel_bookings.csv")

view(hotel_bookings)
head(hotel_bookings)
summary(hotel_bookings)

---I combined some of the columns here using the unite function and renamed the columns to get another look at the data

trimmed_df <- hotel_bookings %>% select(hotel, is_canceled) %>% rename(hotel_type = hotel)
bookings_year_month <- hotel_bookings %>% select(arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month) %>% 
  unite(arrival_month_year, c(arrival_date_month, arrival_date_year))

--- I further explored the data by doing some calculations on the certain variables to get a better understanding like lead_time

hotel_summary <-hotel_bookings %>% group_by(hotel) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(lead_time), min = min(lead_time), max = max(lead_time))
----------------------------------------------------------
Data Vizualization

---I wanted to find out which market segments generate the largest number of bookings,
and where these bookings are made (city hotels or resort hotels)

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(hotel_bookings) +
  geom_bar(aes(market_segment, fill = market_segment)) +
  facet_grid(~hotel) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))

Results = This shows that the online market segment dominates in both hotels by a large margin. 
Therefore the focus of advertisment should be pushed online more to maximize cutomers


--- Next I wanted to know if there was a relationship between lead time and
guests traveling with children for online bookings at city hotels

ggplot(hotel_bookings) + geom_point(aes(lead_time, children))

Results = This shows that there is a common pattern where the more children in the booking, the less in advance these bookings would happen.

This means that all marketing for hotel booking targeting families, should happen closer to the booking dates to maximize family bookings


---Next I wanted to know if customers preffered a time of year for bookings

hotel_bookings$arrival_date_month <- factor(hotel_bookings$arrival_date_month,
  levels = c("January", "February", "March", "April","May", "June", 
   "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"))

ggplot(hotel_bookings) + 
  geom_bar(aes(arrival_date_month, fill = arrival_date_month)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

Results = The graph shows that bookings go up in the seasons of srping and summer, and go down in the seasons of winter and fall.¶
This is when most people take vacations so its best to cater certain marketing strategies to these seasons, escpecially during the warm time of year.¶

Conclusion:
To increase revenue, the patterns and trends need to be acted upon by the marketing team to 
ensure that the target audience is being targeted based on the timings and conditions.
This will ensure higher customer demand and aid in reaching economic succession.
